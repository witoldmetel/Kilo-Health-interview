## Intro

This is boilerplate repository for `react-native` project. 
This boilerplate should be used to initiate every `react-native` project in Kilo.Health.

**Usage:**

1. Clone/Download this repo
2. Remove .git directory
```bash
rm -rf .git
```
3. Rename project by running following script
```bash
yarn rename "<your app name here>" -b <your app bundle id>
```
4. Go read React/JSX style guide ðŸ‘€
5. Go code ðŸš€

## Development prerequisites

- Yarn
- Node
- Fastlane
- Cocapods
- Xcode
- Android Studio
- react-native-cli

## Setup for mac

**PRO TIP:** Make sure youâ€™re connected to the internet!ðŸ™ƒ

Open your terminal or run it inside this project's integrated terminal:

```bash
chmod -R 777 ./scripts
./scripts/reactNativeStarterPack.sh
```

**NOTE:** Script doesn't cover Xcode installation so you have to grab it from [here.](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/)

## Git conventions

Branches should be named in a following manner:

```bash
// new feature
git checkout -b feature/comprehensible-name-<trello card number (if exists)>

// refactoring
git checkout -b refactoring/comprehensible-name-<trello card number (if exists)>

// bugfix
git checkout -b fix/comprehensible-name-<trello card number (if exists)>

// dependency updates
git checkout -b update/package-name-<trello card number (if exists)>
git checkout -b update/orther-comprehensible-name-<trello card number (if exists)>
```

Make sure that for every bigger change you have checked out to new branch.
Same goes for complicated package updates (e.g. `react-native`). Also make
sure to be on the new branch when changing something inside native projects
(namely `ios` and `android` directories).

## Run application

**NOTE:** We always use **Yarn** as our default package manager tool.

```bash 
// start development server
yarn start

// run ios app
yarn ios

// run android app
yarn android
```
